### Description
The Movie Trailer Website project consists of server-side code to store a list of movies titles, along with its respective box art imagery and movie trailer website. The data should be served as a web page allowing visitors to review the movies and watch the trailers of a few of my favorite movies.  
### Running the Map  
To run this project simply do the following:
* Clone it to your local system  
* Open `hoodknockout.html` in any browser
* You can click any of the tourist spots in the list or the markers to show information, do a search 

This project is done in JavaScript using AJAX, KnockoutJs, Google Map API
